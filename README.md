# Diagnosis of Acute Diseases in villages and smaller towns using AI

This project presents a user-friendly web interface designed for symptom analysis and medical diagnosis using AI and machine learning techniques. The interface, built with HTML and CSS, allows users to easily input their symptoms and receive potential diagnoses.

## Key Features:
### Machine Learning Algorithms: 
The backend employs Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost to assess user symptoms and predict illnesses.
* Random Forest: Utilizes multiple decision trees to classify patients as at risk or not for conditions like heart disease and diabetes, based on features such as age, BMI, and blood pressure.
- XGBoost: Analyzes datasets (e.g., Parkinson's) by separating labels from input data, training models to identify disease patterns, and evaluating performance through accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Accessibility
The interface is designed for simplicity, ensuring that individuals with minimal technical knowledge can interact with the system efficiently.

### Ethical Considerations:
The project emphasizes the importance of equity in AI healthcare applications, addressing potential biases in training data and algorithmic decision-making. It advocates for diverse and representative training data, regular evaluations of algorithms, and the establishment of ethical guidelines and regulations to ensure safe and equitable AI use in healthcare.

## This initiative aims to enhance early detection and preventive healthcare while prioritizing patient safety, data protection, and transparency.
